Download the latest Windows `.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/simsapa/simsapa/releases/).

Extract and move the folder, for example to `C:\`.

The `Simsapa Dhamma Reader.exe` starts the application. When running it the first time, it offers to download the database.

To create a desktop shortcut:

- Select the .exe
- Holding **Ctrl+Shift** or **Alt** key, drag it to the desktop. While dragging, it should say "Creating link to ..." rather than moving the .exe file.

The application notifies you when there is a new version available.

To upgrade, simply delete the old Simsapa folder, download a new .zip, extract and move it to the same location.
