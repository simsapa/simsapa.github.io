# Install on MacOS

Download the latest `.dmg.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/simsapa/simsapa/releases/).

Take care to download the file suitable for your CPU, either `M1 (arm64)` or `Intel (x86_64)`.

Extract and open the `.dmg` file.

Drag the Simsapa icon to Applications.

When starting the app, you will see a warning:

<img alt="MacOS Cannot be Opened" src="/images/macos-simsapa-cannot-be-opened-screenshot.png">

**Allow apps from third-party locations:**

Open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General tab

<img alt="MacOS Security and Privacy" src="/images/macos-privacy-open-anyway-screenshot.png">

Click on the lock icon in the bottom left and enter your admin password.

Next to the message `"Simsapa" was blocked because...`, click `Open Anyway`.

Starting the app with the icon will ask again:

<img alt="MacOS Simsapa Cannot Verify" src="/images/macos-simsapa-cannot-verify-screenshot.png">
